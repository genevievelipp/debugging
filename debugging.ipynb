    "We all make mistakes when writing code&mdash;ALL of us. And yes, even expert programmers make mistakes. The difference between the pros and the rest is the ability to minimize those mistakes through the use of best practices and the ability to quickly and efficiently (a) identify the issue, through testing, for example, and (b) find the source of the problem and correct it. This last component is the realm of debugging.\n",

    "There are generally two types of bugs that are most commonly encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Syntax errors\n",
    "These are errors in your code the prevent the code from running. For example, if you forgot to indent correctly in a Python function or left the colon off the end of line with a for loop. These are generally easy to identify without the need for tools simply because the program won't run and it will tell you the line where the mistake is located.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunc(x)\n",
    "    return x + 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "This results in the following error:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  File \"<ipython-input-1-a52aba7de6d5>\", line 1\n",
    "    def myfunc(x)\n",
    "                 ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2. Logic errors\n",
    "These can come in many forms and are generally much harder to identify than syntax errors. For example, let's say we write a function to raise one number to the power of the other number and we want to compute $a^b$ where we want to calculate $5^2$. So we write the code below:\n"

    "That's clearly not 25 and we can see why - we didn't put the inputs in the correct order, so we computed $2^5$ instead. In this case, however, the code *runs* fine, it just doesn't run *correctly*. These types of errors can be far more pernicious than syntax errors since the code doesn't throw an immediate fit. This assumes that the underlying logic of the algorithm is correct, but that there's a typo in the code or an issue with some of the data structures or packages that were used. Consider the following example that's a bit trickier. Let's say we wanted to calculate both the sum of the values in a list ($\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$) and the sum of the squares in the list ($\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$). And as input we give it $[1,2,3]$.

When you click this area, it will present you with a list of the environments available on your system. Select the environment you wish to use to run your code.

    "Once we've launched a debug session, that's when the real power of the tool becomes clear as shown in the figure below. Let's walk through each of the components as shown in the figure below:\n",
    "1. **Debug controls**. This is the main set of tools for debugging and includes the option to (a) *continue* execution until the next breakpoint is reached or if execution terminates, (b) *step over* and stop at the next line of code - doing this allows you to execute the code line-by-line, (c) *step into* a function and show the execution within that function rather than in the parent function, (d) *step out* of a child function back up to the parent function, (e) *restart* execution, and (f) *stop* execution immediately. These controls allow us to carefully navigate through a function to explore its operation. \n",
    "2. **Execution line indicator**. This tells us the next line that will be executed once execution continues.\n",
    "3. **Variable explorer panel**. This shows a list of all panels either in the local scope (e.g. the current function, in this case `factorial()`). This also lists all of the variables in the global scope, such as `num` here, which are not within any function. This may be one of the most important tools in the toolbox. We can look at each and every one of the variables in our code and as we step through the code execution, see how the variables change. We can even click on these values in this variable explorer and change them, which changes them in memory as well. This can be useful if we want to see if changing a value fixes a problem in our code, for example.\n",
    "4. **Watch panel**. This panel allows us to create custom expressions that are evaluated throughout the execution of the program to monitor them throughout. Imagine we had a function that had 1,000 variables and we only were interested in watching how a few of them changed&mdash;in this case we could add those variables to the watchlist and have them updated at each step in our debugging process.\n",
    "5. **Call stack**. The call stack shows the different functions that are run here and as the program steps into each function, the local scope is changed to that function's scope and the function is added to the call stack. If we click on the different items in the call stack, it will show us the current point of execution in each.\n",
    "6. **Debug console**. The debug console allows us to interact with the variables at any step in the execution for which execution is paused. This can be incredibly issue to diagnose potential issues in the program because it allows full interactive access to the current state of the variables in the midst of execution."

While not incorporating the use of breakpoints as the previously described features, this tool gives you the abilities to view and watch variables through line-by-line execution, just as before. We also show another Jupyter tool that can be helpful for debugging, which is the Jupyter:variables console. This is similar to the debugging variable explorer, but is available outside of a debugging session, which makes it highly useful for debugging issues in Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter:variables consoles also have access to the data viewer tool we discussed earlier - extremely helpful for exploring matrices."

    "1. There are two primary types of bugs: syntax errors and logical errors. Syntax errors typically prevent your code from running, so are more easily identified, while logical errors may cause your code to fail silently: producing output, but incorrect output.\n",
    "2. The best debugging tool is the one that helps you understand what's going on in your code well enough to identify and resolve errors.\n",
    "3. `print()` statements can be effectively used for debugging Python, but they require editing code directly, which is often undesirable, and can be cumbersome to use when the code is complex.\n",
    "4. VS Code offers extremely powerful tools for debugging `.py` files that allows you to watch the values of variables at any point in execution, execute custom code at any point in the program interactively, create breakpoints when and where you need them to pause the program, view the contents of matrices (and sort/filter) to inspect every detail of your code, and to step through, line-by-line or run until the nearest breakpoint.\n",
    "5. Most of the VS Code tools for debugging `.py` files can also be applied to Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). Additionally, Jupyter notebooks give you access the the Jupyter:variables console, which gives you access to the state of the variables at all times, even outside of a debugging session."
